# ðŸ§ª FastAPI Test Suite â€” Final Submission

This repository contains a FastAPI application tested with **Pytest**, **HTTPX**, and **SQLAlchemy**, built with support for JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and mocked services like email sending.

Issue #12 focused on ensuring that example data on the OpenAPI Docs page matched for login and registration. This helped testers avoid confusion and copy-paste errors when trying out the API manually. It was resolved by updating the user routes to reflect consistent data, and the issue was closed via [#12](https://github.com/mb2362/event_manager/tree/12-openapi-docs-page-login-and-register-example-data-mismatch).

All issues are merged into the `main` branch and tracked through descriptive commits and pull requests, following Git best practices.


## ðŸ“š Reflection

Through this assignment, I strengthened my understanding of FastAPI's modular structure and improved my comfort working with async testing tools such as HTTPX and pytest-asyncio. I became adept at managing user schemas, authentication logic, and data validation for real-world APIs. Handling multiple GitHub issues also helped solidify a practical Git workflow with feature branching, pull requests, and issue tracking.

One of the more subtle but important lessons came from improving developer experience â€” such as ensuring that OpenAPI example data aligns with test user credentials (#12). These small adjustments can significantly improve usability. Collaborating with mock services, and writing test fixtures to mirror realistic user states also helped me think more like a backend engineer in a production team setting.
