# üß™ FastAPI Test Suite

This repository contains a FastAPI application with an asynchronous test suite using **Pytest**, **HTTPX**, and **SQLAlchemy**. The suite includes support for user authentication, role-based access control, and email service mocking.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Asynchronous testing with `pytest-asyncio`
- Mocked services (e.g., email) using `AsyncMock`
- Role-based access fixtures (e.g., admin, manager, regular user)
- JWT-based authentication with reusable fixtures
- Isolated test database setup
- Coverage-friendly and CI-ready with GitHub Actions

## üêõ Workflow Not Triggering on Push?

If your GitHub Actions workflow doesn't run when you push to `main`, make sure your workflow file includes the correct trigger.

### ‚úÖ To Trigger the Workflow

**Option 1: Make a Commit to main**
- Edit any file in your forked repo (even just add a space).
- Commit the change directly to `main`.
- That will trigger the workflow automatically!

**Option 2: Open a Pull Request**
- Create a new branch.
- Make a small change and push it.
- Open a pull request into `main` ‚Äî this will also trigger the workflow.

**Option 3: Add `workflow_dispatch` to Trigger Manually**
If you want to trigger it manually from the Actions tab, just add this at the top under `on:`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:  # üëà Add this line
```

Then commit this change. You‚Äôll now see a **"Run workflow"** button in the Actions tab.
