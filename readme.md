## âœ… Key Features

- Asynchronous testing with `pytest-asyncio`
- Mocked services (e.g., email) using `AsyncMock`
- Role-based access fixtures (e.g., admin, manager, regular user)
- JWT-based authentication with reusable fixtures
- Isolated test database setup
- Coverage-friendly and CI-ready with GitHub Actions

## ðŸš® [Bug] test_user_schema: First name and nickname validation

### Describe the Bug
`test_user_schema` failed due to missing or invalid `first_name` and `nickname` fields in the schema definition or test data.

### Suggested Fix
Ensure the schema includes optional/required `first_name` and `nickname` fields where expected. Tests should provide valid mock values.

### Resolution
This issue was resolved by providing appropriate values for these fields in the schema or marking them as optional.

Resolved and closed in [#1](https://github.com/mb2362/event_manager/tree/1-test-test_user_schema-fixed-first-name-nickname-errors).

### Final Fix (Fixtures Updated)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def user_base_data_invalid():
    return {
        "username": "john_doe_123",
        "email": "john.doe.example.com",
        "full_name": "John Doe",
        "bio": "I am a software engineer with over 5 years of experience.",
        "profile_picture_url": "https://example.com/profile_pictures/john_doe.jpg"
    }

@pytest.fixture
def user_create_data(user_base_data):
    return {**user_base_data, "password": "SecurePassword123!"}

@pytest.fixture
def user_update_data():
    return {
        "email": "john.doe.new@example.com",
        "full_name": "John H. Doe",
        "bio": "I specialize in backend development with Python and Node.js.",
        "profile_picture_url": "https://example.com/profile_pictures/john_doe_updated.jpg",
        "nickname": "manager_john",
        "first_name": "John",
    }
```
